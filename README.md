# RideShield - AI-Powered Insurance for Gig Workers

An AI-enabled parametric insurance platform that automatically compensates delivery workers when disruption events occur (heavy rainfall, extreme heat, pollution, or local restrictions).

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Platform-based delivery workers from companies like Zomato and Swiggy frequently lose income due to external disruptions such as:
- Heavy rainfall and natural disasters
- Extreme heat
- Severe pollution
- Local restrictions and curfews

These events can cause 20-30% loss in weekly income, while gig workers currently have no protection against such uncontrollable disruptions.

## 💡 Solution

RideShield provides:
- Weekly subscription insurance plans
- Real-time disruption monitoring (weather, pollution, etc.)
- Automatic claim triggering when conditions are met
- Instant compensation for lost income
- No manual claim filing required

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend
- React.js with modern UI/UX
- Real-time weather monitoring dashboard
- Responsive design with gradient themes
- Interactive charts and statistics

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- RESTful API architecture
- Automated cron jobs for weather monitoring

### AI/ML
- Python-based risk scoring model
- Historical weather data analysis
- Fraud detection algorithms

## 📋 Parametric Triggers

| Disruption | Trigger Threshold |
|------------|------------------|
| Heavy Rain | Rainfall > 50 mm |
| Extreme Heat | Temperature > 42°C |
| Severe Pollution | AQI > 400 |
| Curfew/Restrictions | Government restrictions |

## 💰 Pricing Plans

| Plan | Weekly Premium | Max Weekly Payout |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Basic | ₹199 | ₹500 |
| Standard | ₹299 | ₹750 |
| Premium | ₹399 | ₹1000 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gig-insurance-platform
```

2. Install all dependencies
```bash
npm run install-all
```

This will install dependencies for both frontend and backend.

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gig-insurance
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AQICN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Run Everything Together (Recommended)
```bash
npm start
```

This will start both frontend and backend concurrently:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

#### Option 2: Run Separately

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 📱 Application Workflow

1. **Registration**: Rider registers with basic details (name, phone, city, working hours)
2. **Risk Assessment**: AI analyzes data and calculates risk score
3. **Plan Selection**: Rider selects and purchases a weekly insurance plan
4. **Monitoring**: Platform continuously monitors environmental data via APIs
5. **Auto Trigger**: When disruption thresholds are exceeded, claims activate automatically
6. **Payout**: System estimates lost income and transfers payout instantly
